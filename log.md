# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on refactoring some old code from my weather app codepen project to get it to display more reliably across browsers. Some of the code is broken now still, as my installation of Chrome is not displaying this properly but other browsers tested are. Took a look through the source code of my homepage (www.jakenelson.comxa.com) in preparation to refactor that at some point throughout the course of this challenge as well. 

**Thoughts:** CSS centering can be confusing and hard to remember the specifics of. A great resource for centering practically anything is available at (https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/).

### Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added some of my more recent back end development projects to my site at (http://www.jakenelson.comxa.com). Set up a GitHub Page for my site.

Worked on refactoring some code in some of my older front-end projects like my weather app and weather dashboard.

**Thoughts:** Thinking about checking into WordPress and a new (paid) host for my site for the experience of it.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Updated layout of my Github site. Added to do lists to some of my older front-end projects (http://www.codepen.io/JNelson180) to establish workflow for the next few coding sessions.

**Thoughts:** Excited to be reviewing some of these projects, and excited with the progress I've made throughout my time spent with FreeCodeCamp so far.

### Day 3: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished updating my Github site. Messed around with my previously created Weather App for FreeCodeCamp. Decided I'm going to switch to Dark Sky API instead of OpenWeather API as the latter does not support HTTPS with their free service, leaving Chrome users out in the cold.

**Thoughts:** Not much. I'm kind of disappointed that the HTTPS service isn't even offered to a developer/free account on OpenWeather API.

### Day 4: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started to change my weather app from IPAPI and OpenWeatherAPI to freegeoIP and Dark Sky API.

**Thoughts:** HTTPS protocol really should be a service that's offered for any developer account.
