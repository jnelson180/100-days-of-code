# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on refactoring some old code from my weather app codepen project to get it to display more reliably across browsers. Some of the code is broken now still, as my installation of Chrome is not displaying this properly but other browsers tested are. Took a look through the source code of my homepage (www.jakenelson.comxa.com) in preparation to refactor that at some point throughout the course of this challenge as well. 

**Thoughts:** CSS centering can be confusing and hard to remember the specifics of. A great resource for centering practically anything is available at (https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/).

### Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added some of my more recent back end development projects to my site at (http://www.jakenelson.comxa.com). Set up a GitHub Page for my site.

Worked on refactoring some code in some of my older front-end projects like my weather app and weather dashboard.

**Thoughts:** Thinking about checking into WordPress and a new (paid) host for my site for the experience of it.
