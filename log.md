# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on refactoring some old code from my weather app codepen project to get it to display more reliably across browsers. Some of the code is broken now still, as my installation of Chrome is not displaying this properly but other browsers tested are. Took a look through the source code of my homepage (www.jakenelson.comxa.com) in preparation to refactor that at some point throughout the course of this challenge as well. 

**Thoughts:** CSS centering can be confusing and hard to remember the specifics of. A great resource for centering practically anything is available at (https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/).

### Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added some of my more recent back end development projects to my site at (http://www.jakenelson.comxa.com). Set up a GitHub Page for my site.

Worked on refactoring some code in some of my older front-end projects like my weather app and weather dashboard.

**Thoughts:** Thinking about checking into WordPress and a new (paid) host for my site for the experience of it.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Updated layout of my Github site. Added to do lists to some of my older front-end projects (http://www.codepen.io/JNelson180) to establish workflow for the next few coding sessions.

**Thoughts:** Excited to be reviewing some of these projects, and excited with the progress I've made throughout my time spent with FreeCodeCamp so far.

### Day 3: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished updating my Github site. Messed around with my previously created Weather App for FreeCodeCamp. Decided I'm going to switch to Dark Sky API instead of OpenWeather API as the latter does not support HTTPS with their free service, leaving Chrome users out in the cold.

**Thoughts:** Not much. I'm kind of disappointed that the HTTPS service isn't even offered to a developer/free account on OpenWeather API.

### Day 4: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started to change my weather app from IPAPI and OpenWeatherAPI to freegeoIP and Dark Sky API.

**Thoughts:** HTTPS protocol really should be a service that's offered for any developer account.

### Day 5: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I started [JavaScript30](www.javascript30.com) today. Seems awesome. Wes Bos is a great instructor. I got inspired off of the first lesson, the JS Drum Kit, and started a [Javascript Piano App](http://codepen.io/JNelson180/pen/BpobRp?editors=1100).

**Thoughts:** I love how open the coding community is, and how many people are willing to share their knowledge. It's really inspiring to see that.

### Day 6: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked a little more on my Javascript Piano app today. I found out how to use LAME in the Ubuntu CLI to convert WAV files to MP3 and saved a ton of bandwidth for the project.

**Thoughts:** I need to learn more command line tools and shortcuts in Linux.

### Day 7: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked through Javascript 30 challenge of making a JS/CSS clock. Then tweaked the project it to make it my own: https://codepen.io/JNelson180/pen/apNBgE?editors=0110

**Thoughts:** N/A.

### Day 8: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked with JavaScript 30's lesson for Array Cardio, which was great to learn some of the new ES6 functions as well as solidify understanding of array.map, reduce, sort, and filter. Also finished up my JavaScript Clock project.

**Thoughts:** I need to study these methods a little more. And get a new watch.

### Day 9: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started working on rolling my own proxy server, which depending on the technical difficulty, I may decide to host on my Raspberry Pi for home use.

**Thoughts:** Seems to work OK over HTTP, on localhost. Wondering how hard it will be to get it up and running over HTTPS as well, and on my Pi.

### Day 10: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on my proxy server experiment. It works great for a quick Google search right now. I am having an issue getting the clicked URLS from said search to pass correctly through the proxy though. I plan to work on that more in the future, however...

**Thoughts:** With some introspection I have decided that I need to spend more time trying to learn React and get back on track to finish my FreeCodeCamp back-end projects. This project will probably be put on hold for now in an attempt to free up more time to learn React and work FCC.

I have no doubt that using more NPM modules would ease this process, however I am enjoying the challenge a bit too much to add any more dependencies currently.

### Day 11: January 15, 2017

***Today's Progress:** Working with React, learning how to make a basic Tic Tac Toe game. Still some work to do. 

***Thoughts:*** I plan on going back and refactoring a few of my first front end projects from FreeCodeCamp once I get a good handle on React.
