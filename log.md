# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on refactoring some old code from my weather app codepen project to get it to display more reliably across browsers. Some of the code is broken now still, as my installation of Chrome is not displaying this properly but other browsers tested are. Took a look through the source code of my homepage (www.jakenelson.comxa.com) in preparation to refactor that at some point throughout the course of this challenge as well. 

**Thoughts:** CSS centering can be confusing and hard to remember the specifics of. A great resource for centering practically anything is available at (https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/).

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
